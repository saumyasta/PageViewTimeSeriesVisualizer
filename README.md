# PageViewTimeSeriesVisualizer
This is the Page View Time Series Visualizer project. Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn we had to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations would help us understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
